                <h1>About me</h1>
                I am an ordinary guy who likes to learn something new, learn about current news and explore the world. Now my main goal is to learn programming at a high level, because I love mathematics, computer science, and creating something new, such as a beautiful website design.  <br>
                <br>
                I dream of getting my dream job, which will not only be a job, but also my hobby. <br>
                <br>
                I chose the University in Krakow because it is one of the best universities in Poland, and I have heard from all my friends that they produce very competitive specialists in the field of IT technologies. in modern conditions, where scientific and technological progress is moving only forward, it is very important to develop in the field of it.  <br>
                <br>
                Having received a job, I plan to always move forward and never stand still, because progress is development. And the more you develop, the better you can do your job.  <br>
                <br>
                And if you do your job well and efficiently, you will earn more, respectively, you can afford more, that is, travel, learn new things and the world. This is happiness. That is, a happy life begins with a good education and conscientious work in training. <br>

                    <h1> Listening to Music</h1>
                    Listening to music has always been my go to activity for all occasions. My love for music can be traced back to when I was a child. There are recorded videos of me as a child becoming hyperactive whenever music was played. I would run to the stereo, turn on the music to full volume and start running around dancing. Anyone who dared touch the sound system would face my wrath. Music was the only thing that could calm me down whenever I cried.

                    <h1>Travelling</h1>
                    Travelling is one of those few activities that has a kind of reset button in our lives. You go away for a few days or weeks and come back fresh and ready to take on challenges of life head on. Travelling to many people is a matter of convenience, rather than a recreation activity. They only travel when they have an issue to attend to. Travelling is also not for escapists, as many people tend to believe. I used the word ‘escapists’ not in the literary sense of the word, but rather to mean people who run away from their problems. Travelling is a hobby like any other.

                    <h1>Reading Books</h1>
                    I'm passionate about reading. Although I have several hobbies, such as watching movies and hiking, reading books is what resonates well with me. There are many reasons why I love reading. The first reason is it gives me a level of fulfillment. That is, books rejuvenate me. After reading a book, I feel like a whole new being and my outlook in life changes.
